Goal:

Collect and analyze historical weather data (temperature, rainfall, humidity, wind speed, etc.).

Use Elasticsearch for fast analytics and aggregation queries.

Provide REST APIs for querying analytics.

Visualize trends over time or per city.

Rainfall distribution across cities

Seasonal temperature trends

Monthly average temperature per city

Anomaly detection (extreme temperatures, unusual rainfall)
Optionally: JSON/CSV export of analytics
Actors:

Success Criteria:

Elasticsearch index created and data ingested successfully
REST APIs return analytics correctly

Postman tests pass
